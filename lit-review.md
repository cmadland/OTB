Since 2012, when the Minister for Advanced Education in British Columbia announced funding for the creation of openly licensed textbooks for the 40 highest-enrollment courses in BC higher education institutions, BCcampus, the agency tasked with creating and curating the textbooks, estimates that 87,474 students in BC have collectively saved between $8 million and $9 million (“Open Textbook Stats | BCcampus OpenEd Resources,” n.d.). While this is a laudable achievement, it may be that cost savings alone isn't a sufficient rationale for the wholesale adoption of open textbooks in higher education classrooms, particularly if the quality of the resources is low or if students perform more poorly in their classes when open textbooks are utilized. It is thus incumbent upon institutions to gather data on the quality of the resources and on their impact on student outcomes.

The Bliss, Robinson, Hilton, & Wiley (2013) propose that there are four categories of potential benefits to using open textbooks (OTB) in education: cost, outcomes, use, and perception. Together, these four categories form the acronym "COUP". To date, there is a small, but growing body of published research that utilizes the COUP Framework to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of OTB adoptions in higher education, and very few of these studies are based on data from Canadian institutions.

In June 2017, the International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning (IRRODL) published a special issue  devoted to research related to OER adoption and use in education. Included in this special issue were two reports of OER use in Canadian institutions.

Jhangiani and Jhangiani (2017) surveyed 320 students in 19 courses at 12 different institutions in British Columbia and found that students reported spending a median amount of $250 per semester ($500/a) and a mean amount of $350 per semester ($700/a) on textbooks.

Hendricks, Reinsberg, & Rieger (2017) found in their investigation of students in a large, first-year physics course at the University of British Columbia, that most students (48%, n=151) reported spending between $100 and $200 per semester ($200-$400/a). Students in their study reported taking 9 courses per year, meaning that they spent only $22-$44 per course on textbooks, a low enough number to warrant further investigation.

One explanation for the phenomenon of rising textbook costs and relatively flat student spending on textbooks is that students are being driven away from purchasing textbooks altogether or are seeking alternative sources. Some students will delay purchasing a textbook for a couple of weeks in order to determine whether or not the text is actually required for success. Others will simply not purchase a textbook. It should be apparent that going without required course materials will likely have a negative impact on student outcomes.

Trinity Western University, in Langley, BC, is a small, private liberal arts university serving primarily undergraduate students. Based on personal observations and communication with faculty, it seems that there are very few faculty who use OTB as either supplementary or primary resources in their courses. To date, there have been no known surveys of textbook or OTB use at TWU.

As a private university, tuition at TWU is significantly higher than for local public institutions, putting additional financial pressure on students and families. Over 95% of TWU students receive some type of financial aid from the university or from public or private student loans. This puts pressure on the university to maintain fundraising levels.

The purpose of this study was to:
- guage the level of awareness of OTB among TWU faculty and students
- guage the number of OTB adoptions among TWU faculty
- understand more clearly the impact of textbook costs on TWU students
- understand the textbook purchasing behaviours of TWU students
- understand the strategies that TWU students use to reduce spending on Textbooks
- understand the strategies that students use when they do not purchase required textbooks.
