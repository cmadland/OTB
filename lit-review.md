Since 2012, when the Minister for Advanced Education in British Columbia announced funding for the creation of openly licensed textbooks for the 40 highest-enrollment courses in BC higher education institutions, BCcampus, the agency tasked with creating and curating the textbooks, estimates that 87,474 students in BC have collectively saved between $8 million and $9 million (“Open Textbook Stats | BCcampus OpenEd Resources,” n.d.). While this is a laudable achievement, it may be that cost savings alone isn't a sufficient rationale for the wholesale adoption of open textbooks in higher education classrooms, particularly if the quality of the resources is low or if students perform more poorly in their classes when open textbooks are utilized. It is thus incumbent upon institutions to gather data on the quality of the resources and on their impact on student outcomes.

The Bliss, Robinson, Hilton, & Wiley (2013) propose that there are four categories of potential benefits to using open textbooks (OTB) in education: cost, outcomes, use, and perception. Together, these four categories form the acronym "COUP". To date, there is a small, but growing body of published research that utilizes the COUP Framework to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of OTB adoptions in higher education, and very few of these studies are based on data from Canadian institutions.
