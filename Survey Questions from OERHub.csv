,"“Open education models lead to more equitable access to education, serving a broader base of learners than traditional education”"

,HYPOTHESIS D
,“Use of OER is an effective method for improving retention for at-risk students”
,NOTES: This hypothesis will perhaps be best answered through (1) Comparison of demographic information with general figures/national averages; (2) Using metrics for identifying typically at-risk students from the demographic information. (3) Case study qualitative research based around interviews. (4) Institution-provided retention figures.
