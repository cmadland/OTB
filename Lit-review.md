# Literature Review

- most published literature on OTB use is from the US
- recent Canadian studies (Jhangiani & Jhangiani, 2017) found relevant differences between US and Canada, including lower tuition costs in Canada.
- tuition at TWU more in line with US schools `talk to scott f or bob n about specific data`

Investigating the Perceptions, Use, and Impact of Open Textbooks: A survey of Post-Secondary Students in British Columbia
http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3012/4206

- no published Canadian studies of students' perceptions of OER; this survey study is the first to investigate the impact of textbooks costs on Canadian students' educational choices; the first to investigate the use and perceptions of Canadian students who have been assigned open textbooks
- this study's sample consisted of 320 undergraduate students enrolled in 19 courses at 12 BC post-secondary institutions
- Canadian students spend approximately $250 per semester on textbooks (median respondent)
- for most respondents of the survey, the benefits of open textbooks outweighted the costs.
-students perceive open textbooks with high quality and value the cost savings, immediate access, portability, and other benefits.


Incentivizing the Production and Use of Open
Educational Resources in Higher Education Institutions
http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3009/4194

- Why OERs haven't been adopted more widely in higher education? The most significant barrier to OER adoption: too much faculty time was required to locate, evaluate, and incorporate material.
- case study at Athabasca University on their adoption of an open textbook for an introductory financial accounting course; two outcomes: 1) Athabasca U benfits financially from the development and use of OER; 2) developing OERs are recognized as valid scholarly activity for faculty members;
- the essential barrier to OER adoption is "the fact that the cost of textbooks is not borne by those making the textbook selection decision" (students do not make selection decision)
- the solution is to align the financial interests of the intermediaries (faculty) and final consumers (students)
- the key is to align the financial interests of students, faculty and educational institutions.

Open Educational Resources and Student Course
Outcomes: A Multilevel Analysis
http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3118/4196

- horizontal approach to develop OERs
- multi-level modeling (MLM) - hierarchical linear modeling which allows us to take into account variation from the micro- to the meso- to the macro-level; there are three levels in this model: student, instructor, and course
- No significant evidence on the use of OER on student success (measured by course grades) ; there is a small benefit for new students. 
- OER can be implemented in the classroom with no adverse effect on students' grades.
- OER provides tremendous cost savings for students.


The Adoption of an Open Textbook in a Large Physics
Course: An Analysis of Cost, Outcomes, Use, and
Perceptions
http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3006/4200

- case study of adoption of an open textbook in a large physics course (Physics 100) at UBC; the textbook and other learning resources are incorporated onto one single website; news: http://www.phas.ubc.ca/physics-course-adopts-open-textbook-and-saves-students-90000
- besides financial concern, the high cost of textbooks also creates pedagogical concerns.(students might have barriers accessing theor course materials online) 
- cost savings for students, but a lot of time went in for faculty and institutions when using open textbooks
- most students surveyed mentioned that open textbooks have the same or better quality than traditional textbooks
- textbook costs has a small impact on students' academic choices than studies found among US studies
- students' final exam marks and course grades are comparable to the data before; generally students found the textbook useful for their course work
