### Methods

In the spring of 2018, the authors distributed two surveys; one survey was for students, and the other fro faculty and administrators at Trinity Western University. The survey was based on and borrowed many questions from the survey used by Jhangiani and Jhangiani (2017) so that we would be able to compare our results to those obtained from a larger survey of post-secondary institutions in BC.
