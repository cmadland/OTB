Thusfar, this semester we have worked through the general structure of the book and should have reasonable drafts of 4 chapters (out of a potential 10 or 12) by the end of this semester. The book will be developed further in the next offering of Ling 611 this summer by 6~8 more students. The current content will serve as a point of departure that the new students review to  get an overview of the course area. They are then are given responsibilities for some further development of the core main chapters and then each produces an applied chapter focusing the framework of the book on a distinct learner population that they, themselves, have personal experience with. In Fall 2018 there will be one student doing the course as a directed study who will follow the same general process. After the fourth iteration of the course,  in Spring 2019, with 8~10 students, it may well be ready to go public in some limited form. We have about half a dozen content experts from other institutions who will be providing feedback initially to the students and then later, hopefully, they and their students will contribute unique content as well.  ",Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,Strongly agree,"At this point in the semester, with about three weeks to go, all 4 students seem very enthusiastic about what they have learned and the quality of the research that they have done. Their outlines of the chapters look promising. We had the usual family emergencies, crashed computers and broken bones to contend with, along with just the evolution of the course as it emerged. It looks pretty good at the top level now and the overall conceptual framework seems solid. Will see how we land by the end of April. By the end of the summer, the 4 core chapters should be approaching textbook content and format so that we may be able to actually use them in Spring 2019 in place of about 50% of the currently required textbook ""load!""
